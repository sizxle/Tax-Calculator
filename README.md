income tax. Refer to spreadsheet `tax_example_comprehensive_202008_v2` in resources.

## Requirements:

### Project Requirements

    - A standalone calculator is required.
    - Add UI hints to the application, such as input validations messages and toasts etc.
    - Render the tax calculations as a table, as shown in `tax_example_comprehensive_202008_v2`.
    - Make use of good OOP models.
    - Currency should be formatted using thousands separators, e.g., `500,000`, `15,000`.
    - **CHALLENGE:** Adjust the model to factor in a taxpayer who can have many different tax calculations.
- **NO** external libraries or dependencies are to be used. Only vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
